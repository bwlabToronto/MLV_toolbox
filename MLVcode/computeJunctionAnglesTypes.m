function Junctions = computeJunctionAnglesTypes(Junctions,vecLD)
% Junctions = computeJunctionAnglesTypes(Junctions,vecLD)
%       computes the types and angles for the Junctions and adds them
%       to the Junctions data structure.
%
% Input:
%   Junctions - the detected and cleaned up junctions
%   vecLD - the line drawing image for looking up line orientations and
%   lengths.
%
% Return:
%   Junctions - the same junctions with fields types, minAngle and maxAngle added
%                junction type based on maxAngle a, one of 
%                'T': T junction - three segments: 160 < a < 200
%                'Arrow': arrow juctions - three segments: a > 200
%                'Y': Y junctions - three segments: a < 160
%                'X': X junctions - four segments.
%                'L': L junctions - two segments
%                'Star': Star junctions - more than four segments
